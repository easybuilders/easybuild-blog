## Day 0 (Monday 24 March 2025)

### Travel

Even though it was a bit challenging to reach Jülich, seats for in-person attendance for the event were fully booked a month before the event,
even before the program was made public!

50 people coming by all means possible (car, train, plane, bus, minibus and even bike) made it to the venue,
in addition to 90 attendees who registered to follow the event online.

Cintia, Sam, and Alex came by bike from Aachen to Jülich.

The big highlight surrounding this event is the release of [**EasyBuild 5.0**](https://docs.easybuild.io/easybuild-v5/) :tada: .
Congratulations to all contributors and maintainers for the major milestone!

Some other crazy news from the EasyBuild community is the launch of the [EasyBuild + EESSI shop](https://shop.easybuild.io).
All the profits generated by the shop will be destined to cover future events merchandise.

### EasyBuild 5.0

EasyBuild version 5.0 was covered in detail by the following talk, given by Simon Branford (University of Birmingham), EB maintainer.
He explained all the breaking changes, updates and new features. It is expected from now on to make a major release of EasyBuild every two years.
